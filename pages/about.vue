        Welcome to Cogitations AI Reviews — a human-augmented, AI-powered platform for thoughtful and practical evaluations of AI products. 
        Our mission is to help you make informed decisions by offering honest, detailed, and carefully curated reviews.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        We use state-of-the-art AI to generate initial product reviews, then draw on decades of software industry experience to critically assess, edit, and refine them. 
        Every review you read reflects not just algorithmic synthesis, but professional judgment shaped by real-world business and technical expertise.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        While AI can generate thousands of reviews, quantity doesn’t equal clarity. 
        Without domain expertise, it’s easy to drown in a sea of mediocre content and buzzwords. 
        Our team helps you cut through the noise — surfacing only those tools we believe can genuinely improve productivity in your business.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Whether you're a founder, manager, or developer, our goal is to guide you toward just enough technology — not more — to make a meaningful impact.
